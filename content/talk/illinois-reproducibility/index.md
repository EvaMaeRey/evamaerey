abstract: Perhaps you've heard that as an academic you should be working towards a reproducible, transparent workflow.  What does that look like?  This workshop will walk you through a minimal example of how you might set up a research project using popular tools of R and Rmarkdown files with reproducibility as a goal.  Additionally, we'll have a look at some new resources --- "flipbooks" made with "Xaringan" -- that walk through data manipulation pipelines and plotting.  Time permitting, you'll compile your own flipbook, which you can modify to communicate about each decision you make in your analysis.
