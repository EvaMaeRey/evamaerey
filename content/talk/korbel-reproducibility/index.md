abstract:  Reproducible workflows provide transparency and are helpful in tracking progress in a projects.  What are the tools that may be useful to this end?  They vary across What does that look like?  This workshop will walk you through a minimal example of how you might set up a research project using popular tools of R and Rmarkdown files with reproducibility as a goal.  Additionally, we'll have a look at some new resources --- "flipbooks" made with "Xaringan" -- that walk through data manipulation pipelines and plotting.  Time permitting, you'll compile your own flipbook, which you can modify to communicate about each decision you make in your analysis.
