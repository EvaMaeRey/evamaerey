<p>Here is my second post is about how to implement a <em>layered presentation of a graphics</em>. My previous implementation used the alpha transparency aesthetic to hide all but one point. But, now, rethink things, now for the 3rd time or so, I just subset the data associated with the first geom layer, leaving the global data complete.</p>
<p>I think it is more straight forward than messing around with alpha. Several folks brought up geom_blank() having looked at the previous implementation, but I didn’t find it necessary in this case and with the current version of ggplot2: 2.2.1.9000.</p>
<p>This time around, I’ll do a little with labeling too. Before, I left labels as variable names, which wouldn’t really be acceptable in a presentation setting, at least with the present example.</p>
<p>Here again is the original inspiration:</p>
{{% tweet "991004129198854145" %}}
<p>And the goal is simply to write an implementation, with some data:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)
my_data = gapminder %&gt;% filter(continent == &quot;Americas&quot; &amp; year == 2002)</code></pre>
<p>Okay, the data is ready and packages loaded. Now for plotting:</p>
<div id="step-1-just-x-axis-explain-it" class="section level1">
<h1>Step 1: Just x-axis (explain it)</h1>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(my_data) +            # declare the data you want to use
  aes(x = gdpPercap) +       # declare the aesthetic mapping for x
  theme_bw(base_size = 20) + # we want label sizes to be a bit bigger
  labs(x = &quot;Per capita GDP\n(US$, inflation-adjusted)&quot;) </code></pre>

<pre class="r"><code>                             # instead of variable name, we give x axis a nice name</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="step-2-just-y-axis-explain-it" class="section level1">
<h1>Step 2: Just y-axis (explain it)</h1>
<pre class="r"><code>last_plot() +        # we just add to the last plot
  aes(y = lifeExp) + # add the aesthetic mapping for y 
  labs(y = &quot;Life Expectancy\n(years)&quot;) # a nice axis label</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2018-07-22-layered-presentation-of-graphics-with-aes-in-ggplot2-alternative_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" /></p>
</div>
<div id="step-3-add-1-data-point-explain-it" class="section level1">
<h1>Step 3: Add 1 data point (explain it)</h1>
<pre class="r"><code>last_plot() + 
  geom_point(data = my_data %&gt;% filter(country == &quot;Chile&quot;))   # declare the geom to add </code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2018-07-22-layered-presentation-of-graphics-with-aes-in-ggplot2-alternative_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>I use geom_point() to add the layer where Chile’s data is shown. I indicate that I want points to be added for onlly a subset of the data by specifying that with the data argument.</p>
</div>
<div id="step-4-plot-the-rest-of-the-data-explain-it" class="section level1">
<h1>Step 4: Plot the rest of the data (explain it)</h1>
<p>Add another geom_point() layer. This time, the data that will be used is the global data, as there is no data specified in the function.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>last_plot() + 
  geom_point()</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2018-07-22-layered-presentation-of-graphics-with-aes-in-ggplot2-alternative_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="672" /> Done!</p>
<p>Why didn’t I come up with this before? I think it didn’t have the presence of mind because my mind had just been blown by the possibility of adding global aesthetics outside of the ggplot() statement. I was very excited about that discovery! Also, ggplot2 has also had an update since the original implmentation. Perhaps the behavior was different in a previous version. Don’t know. Not gonna check at this point. I guess probably it wasn’t.</p>
