Obviously the circumstances are terrible, and tragic events are unfolding --- now across the entire globe. 
Nevertheless, I'm teaching Data Visualization starting Monday.  I am looking forward to this.  

I'm just jotting some ideas down here -- concepts to cover on day one of Data Visualization.  

1. Data Visualization - Tukey's quotation...

2. Grammar of Graphics

  - simple 3 components
  - history
  - more detail on the components

3. Example, what is a pie chart... 

4. Discussion: Among the components, what is the hero of data viz.  What is the great communicator? 

4. Hadley's quotation - transferable skill...

5. Point to ponder:  Are you more of a "glamour of graphics" person or a "grammar of graphics" person.  

5. Intro to R and RStudio - console and Rmarkdown

6. Intro to Tableau Desktop Public Edition

7. Next week: What is a figure that has made an impact on you?  Articulate why...
