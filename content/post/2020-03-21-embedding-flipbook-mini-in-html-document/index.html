<p>Xaringan is a fantastic rmarkdown presentation tool from Yihui Xie which uses remark.js as its platform. (Yihui Xie has a lot to say about the greatness of remark.js itself in a <a href="https://yihui.org/en/2017/08/why-xaringan-remark-js/" target="_blank">blogpost</a> — worth a read)</p>
<p>One shortcoming of the format might be that the slide shows are not self-contained. So a presentation is usually a whole collection of files. This is obviously true for the <a href="https://evamaerey.github.io/flipbooks/about" target="_blank"><em>flipbooks</em></a> created with the {xaringan} platform.</p>
<p>Having so many files can feel overwhelming – especially when it comes time to share your work. So some time ago, I had the idea of working on something self-contained: a flipbook mini (yup, like “ipod mini”).</p>
<p>The same parsing code is used as for the Xaringan presentation platform. But then instead of <em>printing</em> the code in xaringan, the code is <em>plotted</em> as text in a ggplot object. This code is also evaluated to producing a plot. Then I used the {cowplot} package to pasted these two images side-by-side; the composite is saved as a .png which is a single “frame” of the flipbook. Those steps are performed for each partial build of the code. The resultant side-by-side figures (.png frames) are then combined into a gif for the movie effect.</p>
<p>Currently, I’m calling the function that does this <code>flipbookr::chunk_create_gif_flipbook()</code>. It looks at code in a code chunk, creates frames of a flipbook, and combines them into a gif.</p>

<p>Then, At the RStudio conference someone asked if flipbooks can be directly embedded in blog posts or other html documents in a single call. I fact, I didn’t even present the “mini” at the conference — a lot of work needed to be done on fundamental {flipbookr} internal functions. <em>And it hadn’t even occured to me to try to arrange this embedding function.</em> But this was a great (perhaps obvious?) idea! I’ve been working on the implementation</p>
<p>After the gif is saved out with flipbookr::chunk_create_gif_flipbook(), I pull it back in to embed it with knitr::include_graphics(). The {flipookr} function that wraps all of this up is <code>chunk_gif_flipbook_embed()</code>.</p>
<p>I still have questions about the internals of this function. Should I be using {gifski}, {majick}? Is there a way for the files to <em>just embed</em> like gganimate files seem to be able to? i.e. not saving out the gif and then pulling back in? With gganimate feels like a “true embed” — I don’t really have the terminology to talk about this… This seems relevant: <a href="https://yihui.org/en/2018/08/gifski-knitr/" class="uri">https://yihui.org/en/2018/08/gifski-knitr/</a></p>

<p>Then I tried to embed in blogdown, but when I served the site, the paths to the gifs were broken. So I instead made a pseudo-blogpost (just pushing an html to github pages), whined and asked for help, and called it a day.</p>

Working on that self-contained, flipbook that you can just embed into an HTML from an Rmarkdown file. But finding it tricky, esp. w/ blogdown.

<h1>Expert help</h1>
<p>I failed to ‘mention’ <span class="citation">@apreshill</span> in my initial plea. But she is so knowledge about all thinks {rmarkdown}. When I got around to asking her, she was kind enough to do lots of trouble shooting, to get to solutions.</p>
<p>Basically, “bundling” my blogpost was going to be the solution to make sure the file path to the .gif would be maintained.</p>

It might be easier to debug if you used bundled blog posts (<a href="https://t.co/GzxYGUx79C">https://t.co/GzxYGUx79C</a>) and set the fig path for each individual post to export the Rmd fig to the page bundle itself (<a href="https://t.co/u0D8IVME2T">https://t.co/u0D8IVME2T</a>)

<p>I did this manually.</p>

<li>I created a folder in my content/post folder, giving it the name that the blog post file had (no .Rmd extension obviously)</li>

<div id="back-in-business-with-blogdown-lets-embed-a-flipbook-mini" class="section level1">
<h1>Back in business with blogdown: Let’s embed a flipbook mini</h1>
<p>So with the having addressed bundling, we can now talk about embedding the gif.</p>
<p>First you’ll have an input code chunk that you’ll refer to by name (I’m calling it cars_plot, and I have echo set to true, but you can do echo = F):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(data = cars) +
  aes(x = speed) +
  aes(y = dist) +
  geom_point(shape = 21, 
             alpha = .75,
             color = &quot;white&quot;) +
  aes(fill = dist) +
  aes(size = speed) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(end = .9, 
                       option = &quot;magma&quot;) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.background = 
          element_rect(fill = &quot;grey90&quot;))</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2020-03-21-embedding-flipbook-mini-in-html-document/index_files/figure-html/cars_plot-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Then you can embed the flipbook mini as follows (again you might want to set echo to false in the code chunk options):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(flipbookr)
chunk_gif_flipbook_embed(chunk_name = &quot;cars_plot&quot;, 
                         display_type = &quot;output&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="temp_minicars_plotoutput.gif" /><!-- --></p>
<p>You might of course want to show the code and the output side-by-side – the classic flipbook.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>chunk_gif_flipbook_embed(chunk_name = &quot;cars_plot&quot;, 
                         display_type = &quot;both&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="temp_minicars_plotboth.gif" /><!-- --></p>
</div>
<div id="limitations" class="section level1">
<h1>Limitations!</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>The flipbook mini function works with plot outputs <em>only</em> for the time being.</p></li>
<li><p>You cannot copy and paste code from a flipbook mini.</p></li>
<li><p>The embedded gif moves at a constant rate forward, you can’t toggle between states as you might do with the traditional flipbook.</p></li>
<li><p>Also, Claus Wilke has noted that the flipbooks aspect ratio control needs some work – which is really apparent in the flipbook mini and is also an issue on the {xaringan} platform. This has been duely noted and is logged as an issue in the development package — ideas welcome!</p></li>
<li><p>One must bundle in blogdown (see above).</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="more-ways-of-embedding" class="section level1">
<h1>More ways of embedding…</h1>
<p>Another way you can share flipbooks is using the knitr function include_url() within a code chunk. I think I learned this from Emi Tanaka initially!</p>
