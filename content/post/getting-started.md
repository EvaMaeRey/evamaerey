summary = "'Create a beautifully simple website or blog in under 10 minutes'?  It took me longer than 10 minutes.  But okay.  I'm using it with blogdown too, so I guess I cannot complain.  The idea of Blogdown is to allow you to integrate your coding with your blogging.  I actually haven't blogged, but I do do a lot of coding.  So for me this will be about adding some sentences to the coding and sharing.  

This post is modified from a template post from Academic Hugo.  I retain some of that information so you can check it out.  I provide some links to helpful cites for Blogdown."
