<p>Xaringan is a fantastic rmarkdown presentation tool from Yihui Xie which uses remark.js as its platform. (Yihui Xie has a lot to say about the greatness of remark.js itself in a <a href="https://yihui.org/en/2017/08/why-xaringan-remark-js/" target="_blank">blogpost</a> — worth a read)<br />
One shortcoming of the format is that the slide shows are not self-contained. So a presentation is usually a whole collection of files. This is obviously true for <a href=""><em>flipbooks</em></a> created with the {xaringan} platform.</p>
<p>Having so many files might feel a bit overwhelming, especially when it comes time to share your work. So some time ago, I had the idea of working on something self-contained: a flipbook mini (yup, like “ipod mini”). What’s been worked out is using all the parsing code from {flipbookr} and then plotting the code itself in a ggplot, and producing the plot output. Then using {cowplot} the images are pasted side-by-side together. This is done for each partial build of the code. The resultant side-by-side figures are then combined into a gif for the movie effect.</p>

<p>At the RStudio conference someone asked if flipbooks can be embedded in blog posts or other html documents. By conference time, I thought I’d have the mini to demo — but I didn’t, as a lot of work needed to be done on fundamental {flipbookr} internal functions. I also didn’t think of directly embedding into html. But now the embed too is basically worked out. After the gif is saved out with flipbookr::chunk_create_gif_flipbook(), I can pull it back in to embed it (this is done with knitr::include_graphics()). The {flipookr} function used to get all this done is <code>chunk_gif_flipbook_embed()</code>. Sadly, this doesn’t work in blogdown!</p>
<p>All of this feels a little awkward so if there are better ways of going about it, do let me know! Check out the details of the implementation <a href="https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/flipbookr/blob/master/R/mini.R">here</a>.</p>
<p>So, first you’ll have an input code chunk that you’ll refer to by name (I’m calling it cars_plot, and I have echo set to true, but you can do echo = F):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(data = cars) +
  aes(x = speed) +
  aes(y = dist) +
  geom_point(shape = 21, 
             alpha = .75,
             color = &quot;white&quot;) +
  aes(fill = dist) +
  aes(size = speed) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(end = .9, 
                       option = &quot;magma&quot;) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.background = 
          element_rect(fill = &quot;grey90&quot;))</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2020-03-21-embedding-flipbook-mini-in-html-document_files/figure-html/cars_plot-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Then you can embed the flipbook mini as follows (again you might want to set echo to false in the code chunk options):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(flipbookr)
chunk_gif_flipbook_embed(chunk_name = &quot;cars_plot&quot;, 
                         display_type = &quot;output&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Joining, by = &quot;line&quot;
## Joining, by = &quot;line&quot;
## Joining, by = &quot;line&quot;
## Joining, by = &quot;line&quot;</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Warning in dir.create(path = dir): &#39;temp_mini_figurescars_plot&#39; already exists</code></pre>
<p><img src="temp_minicars_plotoutput.gif" /><!-- --></p>
<p>You might of course want to show the code and the output side-by-side – the classic flipbook.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>chunk_gif_flipbook_embed(chunk_name = &quot;cars_plot&quot;, 
                         display_type = &quot;output&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Joining, by = &quot;line&quot;
## Joining, by = &quot;line&quot;
## Joining, by = &quot;line&quot;
## Joining, by = &quot;line&quot;</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Warning in dir.create(path = dir): &#39;temp_mini_figurescars_plot&#39; already exists</code></pre>
<p><img src="temp_minicars_plotoutput.gif" /><!-- --></p>
<div id="limitations" class="section level1">
<h1>Limitations!</h1>
<p>The flipbook mini function works with plot outputs <em>only</em> for the time being.</p>
<p>Also, Claus Wilke has noted that the flipbooks aspect ratio control needs some work – which is really apparent in the flipbook mini and is also an issue on the {xaringan} platform. This has been duely noted and is logged as an issue in the development package — help welcome!</p>

<h1>More ways of embedding…</h1>
<p>Another way you can share flipbooks is using the knitr function include_url() within a code chunk. I think I learned this from Emi Tanaka initially!</p>
<pre class="r"><code>knitr::include_url(&quot;https://evamaerey.github.io/tidytuesday_walk_through/tidytuesday_highlights.html&quot;)</code></pre>
