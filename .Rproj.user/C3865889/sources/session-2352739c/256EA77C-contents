Quantitative analysis informs understanding in a multitude of fields. Experience with data handling, visualization, and analyses can help scholars contribute new insights in their study areas, and evaluate other quantitative work critically. I believe statistical instruction should embrace a proverb attributed to Confucius is 'Tell me and I forget. Show me and I remember. Let me do and I understand.' Thus my teaching and work seeks to work much in the showing and doing knowledge transfer realm.

Being able to visualize statistical concepts is key *showing* the concept to students. For example, drawing out the statistical summaries in Anscombe's quartet is my preference over just stating that summary statistics are the same; below are depicted means for x and y, as well as a standard deviation away from the means, and ordinary least squares regression lines --- quantities that are typically communicated in a table separately from the visualization.

Toward 'letting students do', I'm working on ways to make building visualization of statistical concepts easy and accessible to students, via ggplot2 extension packages. Code from the {ggxmean} package that I've written makes displaying these quantities easy for students as well.

I think that tools like {ggxmean} are in line with the 'Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education' (GAISE) report's advise that '...mastery of advanced programming skills should not be allowed to crowd out data analysis skills or statistical thinking.' Without a tool like {ggxmean}, students might go down a programming (stack overflow) rabbit hole, instead of being able to focus on statistical properties.

<!-- That statistical summary tools be easy to use will also allow more 'situated learning'; so students not only can see the picture of these summary statistics with toy data, but also with some data that is of interest to them -- perhaps a data set they are analyzing for a course final project. -->

When appropriate, however, guiding students in programming skills is desirable; for example in a course on statistical computing. In this past term, I've advised two undergraduate students at West Point on creating their own ggplot2 geom layers for statistical learning and explanation on cooks distance and leverage calculations.

See also this translation of equation representation of variance, covariance, standard deviation, and correlation to a [visual representation](https://evamaerey.github.io/statistics/covariance_correlation.html). Below is a single step in that visual narrative. For students that may have 'equation anxiety', the visual approach my do a better job meeting them in their comfort zone. The step-by-step translation to the equation version might help equations feel more comfortable.

# "Experi" Latin, meaning to try

*Experi* is the etymological root of "experiment", "experience" and "expert". Students should be on the path of building expertise via coursework; this requires experiences and experimentation in addition to instruction and discussion. Creating a classroom of experiential learning is important; therefore there is a strong "lab" component to my classes.

Towards this aim, I present concepts from a concrete vantage point, with compelling, discipline-relevant examples to hold students' interest. For example, in a class I taught in Social Science data analysis, I use a data set on fisheries capture and aquaculture around the world to discuss resource conflict. Students use the data to contextualize the Chilean-Peruvian maritime dispute, adjudicated at the International Court of Justice. Then we put the modern dispute in historical perspective recalling the War of the Pacific fought over Salt Peter in this region, a valuable fertilizer and explosives input; the synthetic process for fertilizer production, the Haber process, developed in the early 1900s dramatically changed the market for Salt Peter in the world, and in turn local resource conflict. This case engages students' interest, while presents realistic data analytic challenges. Other classic IR data sets I use include the collection of UN General Assembly votes, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute nuclear explosions dataset, and a cross-country panel dataset of life expectancy, population, and wealth variables.

My students apply the skills they have learned in individual projects in which they pose a theoretical question and try to answer that question with data. This gives them a chance to think through the logic of their new theoretical knowledge and to practice the skills learned in the course, building their experiential knowledge and capacity to work through challenges. I would aim to deliver the same experiential learning experiences in any online teaching I undertake in the future at University of Washington.

# Code-output walk-throughs

My flipbooks project is also driven by the concurrent desire to meet newcomers where they are at and to efficiently put powerful tools into their hands.  'Flipbooks' enables easy presentation of code pipeline presented step-by-step with output.  These steps are aligned on slides of a slide show to give a movie effect, so following along is less effortful.

Flipbooks help students more easily make sense of data manipulation, plotting, and modeling code pipelines. They minimize the guesswork about how code and its output relate by presenting code pipelines side-by-side with its output in an incremental fashion.

<!-- It is hard to overstate the impact of the grammar of graphics framework philosophy for thinking about data visualization. Several tools implement this framework including Tableau, D3 and ggplot2. Given that ggplot2 is implemented in powerful open source programming language R --- which has unparallelled native and contributed statistical analysis tools, as well as a large suite of data manipulation tools --- education in ggplot2 is of great import towards handing students an analysis tool that will serve them well for use in end-to-end analysis. -->

My [ggplot2 flipbook](https://evamaerey.github.io/ggplot_flipbook/ggplot_flipbook_xaringan.html) and [ggplot2 grammar guide](https://evamaerey.github.io/ggplot2_grammar_guide/ggplot2_grammar_guide), are demonstrations of this flipbook technique for communicating about how to build statistical graphics. One of my Masters students at DU, new to working programmatically, has said, "When I was going through one of the books, it just clicked for me: I can do this too."

My [flipbookr](https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/flipbookr) R package is a tool aimed at building flipbooks efficiently and painlessly on the Xaringan slideshow platform. It has primarily been used by educators. New work is aimed at making 'flipbooking' accessible to students as well.
