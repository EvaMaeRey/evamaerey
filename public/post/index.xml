      <title>Layered Presentation of Graphics with &#43;aes() in ggplot2</title>

      <description>Here is my second post is about how to implement a layered presentation of a graphics. My previous implementation used the alpha transparency aesthetic to hide all but one point. But, now, rethink things, now for the 3rd time or so, I just subset the data associated with the first geom layer, leaving the global data complete.
I think it is more straight forward than messing around with alpha. Several folks brought up geom_blank() having looked at the previous implementation, but I didn’t find it necessary in this case and with the current version of ggplot2: 2.</description>

      <title>Where should you declare aesthetics?  Globally, or geom-by-geom?</title>

      <description>Where should you declare aesthetics? Globally or in the geom_*() function? The answer to this question, in some sense is personal preference, because there are simply different ways to get the same job done in the ggplot architecture. My preference is declaring all aesthetic mappings as global unless there are conflicts.
Below is an example that, I hope, will persuade you to my preference. We graph the increase in life expectancy by year for three countries.</description>

      <description>A wide data storage format is an efficient and compact way to store information. And this organization perhaps it makes data easier to inspect. We have wide monitors our laptops and destops. However, for visualization and analysis you generally need to transform this data from the wide format to a “tidy”, long format.
We look at the case where just one variable is stored in a spreadsheet.
library(tidyverse) Suppose you have a data frame of rankings of schools by year, and the initial data set is organized as follows (I just build one with tribble()):</description>

      <description>Saw this tweet by @Nolan_Mc, and thought, this is good fodder for a quick blog post – a true one-hour one-off.
My limited goals:
 translate to R code visualize  Perhaps the central difference between working in the Stata environment and in R is that in R you always have to be declaring which data frame you are working with. In Stata, you just have one active data frame and then you can refer to the variables by their names alone.</description>

      <description>@drob has posted code to play with on Twitter today. To illustrate what he calls a veridical paradox he’s posted the set up, the code and result of a coin flipping experiment:
There are some good and exact explanations in the thread, for this at-first-glance puzzle. But I didn’t see a visualization that might give you quick intuition about what is going on.
So I prepare one here. We’ll use the tidyverse packages and stringr.</description>

      <description>Every couple of weeks I like to explore data that’s brand new to me. I anticipate a one-hour, one-off project. Usually this turns out to be a beautiful lie, and the projects chew up much more time. Still, this enticing time-line is pulling me into new projects from time to time.
Earlier this week, I heard about the dispute of authorship of some of the Federalist papers.
I mentally flagged the topic for one a one-hour, one-off.</description>

      <title>Covariance -- A Visual Walk Through</title>

      <description>In a previous post, I’ve looked at walking through the calculation of variance and standard deviation, visualizing each step. This post is dedicated to the visualization of another statistic: covariance.
Covariance is a measure of the joint variability of two random variables.
Let’s have a look at the sample covariance equation over all:
\(cov(x,y) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\overline{x})(y_i-\overline{y})}{n-1}\)
And now lets apply the equation to the following case:
Ready? Okay, now let’s walk through the calculation; there are 7 small steps:</description>

      <description>What’s the cost of eating near an iconic location? We all might suspect eating in a fun location is pricier. I used the menu and restaurant location data that #MakeoverMonday “assigned” one week last December to demonstrate this among London Wetherspoon Pubs.
#MakeoverMonday is a fun data visualization initiative; most participants use Tableau as their preferred visualization tool. But I’ve used R and ggplot() and the organizers and participants have been very welcoming.</description>

      <description>The International Organization v2.3 dataset is a rich resource for scholars of international relations. Tracking the existence of international organizations and country memberships in them, the data’s various version have been cited over 450 times. Version 2.3 covers the time period 1815 to 2005, and records information about 529 IGOs and membership information for over two million country-igo-year observations. Before 1965, coding was performed only every five years; thereafter information about IGOs and membership is available on an annual basis.</description>

      <description>Sir Francis Galton described the Central Limit Theorem in this way:
I know of scarcely anything so apt to impress the imagination as the wonderful form of cosmic order expressed by the “Law of Frequency of Error”
Why is Sir Francis Galton so excited? Because the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) gives us such clear expectations for random sample means! (A random sample mean is simply the mean of a value for a random sample from a population of interest.</description>

      <description>This post goes back and forth between computing statistics for a single variable and visualizing these values. I’m using a subset of the gapminder dataset — European countries in 2007, and focusing on the Life Expectancy variable.
This post is developed from lecture slides for my great students in my intro to data science and statistics course at TU Dresden.
I’m most excited about the walk-through of the variance calculation. In preparing to lecture on univariate stats, I came across a nice visualization of variance explained but couldn’t find a visualization just focused on explaining the variance itself.</description>

      <description>In February, I made a plot on athletes ages at the Winter Olympics for the data visualization initiative #MakeoverMonday. The initiative is mostly Tableau enthusiasts practicing data visualization techniques. I use it to practice visualization with R. It also serves as a forum for chatting about what works and what doesn’t work in communication data visually which can be good food for thought. My viz had this description:
@Staticum, who I think is a statistical/data science start-up in Chile asked me to share the code.</description>

      <description>Here is the post is about how to implement a layered presentation of a graphics. Matthew Blackwell tweeted about the concept earlier this year, which seemed to reasonated with a lot of folks - to the tune of &amp;gt; 1500 likes! Practical, pedegogical stuff tends to get people excited. True for me too.
Anyway, this to me sounded a lot like the ggplot “layered grammar of graphics” ideology, and I retweeted this thought which resonated with a lot fewer people!</description>

      <description>This is my first post just a test of blogdown.
It seems to be working fine also with this R code.
x = 5 x^2 ## [1] 25 And this Python code:
print(&amp;quot;hello&amp;quot; + &amp;quot;there&amp;quot;) ## hellothere Let’s check out how a graph looks too:
library(ggplot2) ggplot(mtcars) + aes(mpg, disp, col = as.factor(cyl)) + geom_point() Looks good. I’m very satisfied. Hooray for blogdown!</description>
