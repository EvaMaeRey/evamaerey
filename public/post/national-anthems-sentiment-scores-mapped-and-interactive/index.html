<h1>Background</h1>
<p>This post, as indicated in the title, is about an interactive mapping of sentiment scores calculated for national anthems. Text analysis is of growing interest for political researchers, and I count myself among the interested! The interactive plot at the end of the post is, I think, an ideal introduction sentiment analysis. It highlights opportunities, and also, perhaps, some pitfalls.</p>
<p>I want to give quick background on how this happens to be in my blog, to give plenty of credit where it is due. I came across the following tweet of some folks that I met at the Lorentz Workshop ‘Empirical Research on International Organizations’ held in the Netherlands in January, 2018.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What kind of sentiment do national anthems produce? The lighter the color, the more negative sentiment. Collaborative work with my colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/Jarek_Kantor?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Jarek_Kantor</a> <a href="https://t.co/pZI34QONyn">pic.twitter.com/pZI34QONyn</a></p>&mdash; Marinko Bobic (@marinkobobic) <a href="https://twitter.com/marinkobobic/status/996874882515337216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 16, 2018</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>What a great idea! The national anthems are a small, but tremendously interesting corpus. Most people are intimately familiar with at least one document (their own country’s anthem), and will be interested in the resulting sentiment score and how it compares to other countries’. And the visualizing an outcome like a sentiment score on a map is an appealing way to communicate results.</p>
<p>By the way, Marinko is a graduate student and Jarek is a Assistant Professor at the University of Leiden. Jarek was also instrumental in bringing us together at the conference, as one of the proposers and organizers. (Thanks for the many emails on logistics, Jarek!) Thinking of proposing a Lorentz workshop yourself? You don’t have to be local. <a href="https://www.lorentzcenter.nl/proposals.php">Here</a> is the link to find out details on organizing a Lorentz workshop.</p>
<p>Back to sentiment analysis. To briefly describe the work up to this point, Marinko and Jarek gathered English translations of the anthem texts from a few of websites, wikipedia, lyricsondemand.com, and nationalanthems.info.</p>
<p>Then they performed a sentiment scoring using the software Sentistrength; <a href="http://sentistrength.wlv.ac.uk/">here</a> you can read more about the algorithm, performance, and how it has been used. Sentistrength returns two sentiment strengths: both strength of positive and of negative sentiments. Here are distibutions on both of those measures for the anthems in their dataset.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2018-08-04-national-anthems-sentiment-scores-mapped-and-interactive_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="240" /><img src="/post/2018-08-04-national-anthems-sentiment-scores-mapped-and-interactive_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-2.png" width="240" /> You see that there is less variation on the positive than the negative sentiment scores.</p>
<p>Marinko and Jarek mapped the <em>difference in absolute value</em> for these two sentiment scores, which is also what we do for the interactive version. Here is that distribution:</p>
<p><img src="/post/2018-08-04-national-anthems-sentiment-scores-mapped-and-interactive_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="672" /></p>
</div>
<div id="interactive-version" class="section level1">
<h1>Interactive version</h1>
<p>So after seeing their initial work, I proposed an interactive version so that people that are new to text-as-data analyses could see the exact texts that produced the variation in scores. Marinko and Jarek agreed. We used r + plotly to produce this final (but still draft) interactive version; when you mouse over a country, the value for the magnitude difference (positive - negative) is displayed, as well as the anthem text! For best results view on a full size tablet or computer.</p>
<p>Enjoy exploring!</p>

Thou has flooded and<br />poured, in a bright tale of life, Through field, woodland, hill and<br />vale streaming... From thy native flower-copses thy crown is made<br />bright, Like a swan' plumage, brilliant gleaming. Thou dost quiver<br />and echo with songs of the bards, Long-past years thou dost raise up<br />and nurture, Today's forward leap thou wouldst never retard, Boldly<br />facing mysterious futures.

Ceaselessly for the people's cause let us struggle, Let<br />us hasten to the battlefield! Forward! All together advancing! Our<br />Vietnam is strong, eternal.","Yemen: Repeat, O World, my song. Echo it over and over again.<br />Remember, through my joy, each martyr. Clothe him with the shining<br />mantles of our festivals. Repeat, O World, my song. My unity, Oh<br />marvelous song which fills my heart, You are the promise of all to<br />come, My banner, Oh cloth nailed from every sun Raised forever, on<br />every peak My nation, give me strength, Oh source of strength And<br />save me for you, the best of nations. In faith and love I am part of<br />mankind, And I shall march first among the Arabs. And my heart beat<br />shall remain that of a Yemenite. No foreigner shall ever hold dominion<br />over Yemen.","Zambia: Stand and sing of Zambia, proud and free, Land of work and joy<br />in unity, Victors in the struggle for the right, We have won freedom's<br />fight. All one, strong and free. Africa is our own motherland,<br />Fashion'd with and blessed by God's good hand, Let us all her people<br />join as one, Brothers under the sun. All one, strong and free. One<br />land and one nation is our cry, Dignity and peace 'neath Zambia's<br />sky, Like our noble eagle in its flight, Zambia, praise to thee. All<br />one, strong and free. Praise be to God. Praise be, praise be, praise<br />be, Bless our great nation, Zambia, Zambia, Zambia. Free men we stand<br />Under the flag of our land. Zambia, praise to thee! All one, strong<br />and free.","Zimbabwe: O lift high the banner, the flag of Zimbabwe The symbol of<br />freedom proclaiming victory; We praise our heros' sacrifice, And vow<br />to keep our land from foes; And may the Almighty protect and bless<br />our land. O lovely Zimbabwe, so wondrously adorned With mountains, and<br />rivers cascading, flowing free; May rain abound, and fertile fields;<br />May we be fed, our labour blessed; And may the Almighty protect and<br />bless our land. O God, we beseech Thee to bless our native land; The<br />land of our fathers bestowed upon us all; From Zambezi to Limpopo May<br />leaders be exemplary; And may the Almighty protect and bless our land."],"locations":["AFG","ALB","DZA","AND","AGO","ATG","ARG","ARM","AUS","AUT","AZE","BHS","BHR","BGD","BRB","BLR","BEL","BLZ","BEN","BTN","BOL","BIH","BWA","BRA","BRN","BGR","BFA","MMR","MMR","BDI","CPV","KHM","CMR","CAN","CAF","TCD","CHL","CHN","COL","COM","COD","COG","CRI","CIV","HRV","CUB","CYP","CZE","DNK","DJI","DMA","DOM","ECU","EGY","SLV","GNQ","ERI","EST","ETH","FJI","FIN","FRA","GAB","GMB","GEO","DEU","GHA","GRC","GRD","GTM","GNB","GIN","GUY","HTI","HND","HUN","ISL","IND","IDN","IRN","IRQ","IRL","ISR","ITA","JAM","JPN","JOR","KAZ","KEN","KIR","PRK","KOR","KSV","KWT","KGZ","LAO","LVA","LBN","LSO","LBR","LBY","LIE","LTU","LUX","MKD","MDG","MWI","MYS","MDV","MLI","MLT","MHL","MRT","MUS","MEX","FSM","MDA","MCO","MNG","MNE","MAR","MOZ","NAM","NPL","NLD","NZL","NIC","NGA","NER","NOR","OMN","PAK","PLW","PAN","PNG","PRY","PER","PHL","POL","PRT","QAT","ROU","RUS","RUS","RWA","KNA","LCA","VCT","WSM","SMR","STP","SAU","SEN","SRB","SYC","SLE","SGP","SVK","SVN","SLB","SOM","ZAF","SSD","ESP","LKA","SDN","SUR","SWZ","SWE","CHE","SYR","TWN","TJK","TZA","THA","TLS","TGO","TON","TTO","TUN","TUR","TKM","TUV","UGA","UKR","ARE","GBR","USA","URY","UZB","VUT","VEN","VNM","YEM","ZMB","ZWE"],"marker":{"line":{"color":"rgba(190,190,190,1)","width":0.5}},"type":"choropleth","geo":"geo","frame":null}],"highlight":{"on":"plotly_click","persistent":false,"dynamic":false,"selectize":false,"opacityDim":0.2,"selected":{"opacity":1}},"base_url":"https://plot.ly"},"evals":["config.modeBarButtonsToAdd.0.click"],"jsHooks":{"render":[{"code":"function(el, x) { var ctConfig = crosstalk.var('plotlyCrosstalkOpts').set({\"on\":\"plotly_click\",\"persistent\":false,\"dynamic\":false,\"selectize\":false,\"opacityDim\":0.2,\"selected\":{\"opacity\":1}}); }","data":null},{"code":"function(el, x) { var ctConfig = crosstalk.var('plotlyCrosstalkOpts').set({\"on\":\"plotly_click\",\"persistent\":false,\"dynamic\":false,\"selectize\":false,\"opacityDim\":0.2,\"selected\":{\"opacity\":1}}); }","data":null}]}}</script>

<h1>Lessons?</h1>
<p>We think that at least one important lesson can be demonstrated with this tool: interpretation should be cautious and informed by a reading of a good sample of texts at different sentiment levels. When survaying the map, we see some regions where negative scores are greater than the positive scores, for example the Americas. We might be tempted to conclude that the outlook in the Americas is pessimistic based on their anthems. However, much of the negative language is due to discussion of overcoming oppression, reflecting colonial histories; there may be a large share of negative words in what are ultimately very hopeful and inspiring texts.</p>
