      <description>Dissertation: Supranational Law and Compliance
My dissertation project focuses supranational law (law that is not consent-based) and on reputation as a motivation for compliance with International Law. Reputation has been an important explanation for states&amp;rsquo; compliance with international law. Does reputation motivate states to comply as is purported? Many studies assert that compliance indeed has a reputational explanation but struggle with problems of endogeneity and selection given that international law is usually consent based.</description>
