# Hi. I'm Gina Reynolds.

My popular projects include [flipbookr](https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/flipbookr) and ggplot2 extensions like [ggcalendar](https://evamaerey.github.io/ggcalendar/), [ggcirclepack](https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/ggcirclepack) and others.  

Professionally, I've worked in higher education and government where my work involved analytics, teaching, and policy implementation.   

I'm interested in lightening cognative load, first, for interpreting data visualization and, second, for writing and reading code used to build data visualizations.  I believe the latter --- attention to coding tools --- can greatly complement the former -- communication via visualizations. When we have logical, easy-to-use tools to build compelling, easy-to-interpret visualizations well suited to the data we are presenting, we're more likely to build compelling, easy-to-interpret visualizations, rather than stop at 'good enough'.   Given this, I'm a big fan of the elegant, flexible, and intuitive grammar of graphics visualization frameworks. 

My technical expertise is in the ggplot2 library of the R language and currently focus a great deal on extension.  I co-organize the ggplot2 extenders club, have created 'easy geom recipes' together with students, am writing ggplot2 extension cookbook, and developing 'express' methodologies for Stat extension (why shouldn't everyone be creating and using Stats and why shouldn't they be using them even on an Ad Hoc basis?).  I've studied some of these new educational materials via survey response and focus groups. For more on the rationale for these efforts, see 'everyday ggplot2 extension'.

Previously, I had a greater focus on illuminating the grammar of *base* ggplot2, creating materials like [a ggplot2 grammar guide](https://evamaerey.github.io/ggplot2_grammar_guide/about) and [the ggplot2 flipbook](https://evamaerey.github.io/ggplot_flipbook/ggplot_flipbook_xaringan.html#1).
