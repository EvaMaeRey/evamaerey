# Hi. I'm Gina Reynolds.

My popular projects include flipbookr and ggplot2 extensions like ggcalendar, ggcirclepack and others.  I've worked in higher education and government in analytics, in the classroom, and policy implementation.   

I'm interested in lightening cognative load for interpreting data visualization as well as writing and reading the code to build data visualizations.  I believe the latter (coding tools) to greatly complement the former (communication tool of a visualization itself) - if have logical, concise tools to build compelling and easy-to-interpret visualizations, then we're more likely to build compelling easy-to-interpret visualizations.   Given this, I'm a huge proponent of the elegant, flexible, and intuitive grammar of graphics visualization frameworks. 

My technical expertise is in ggplot2 in the R language, which I'm involved in creating community and educational materials around. I co-organize the ggplot2 extenders club, created 'easy geom recipes' together with students, am working on the ggplot2 extension cookbook, and develop express methodologies for Stat extension (why shouldn't everyone be creating and using Stats?).  I've studied some of these new educational materials via survey response and focus groups.
