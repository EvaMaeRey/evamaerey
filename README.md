# Hi. I'm Gina Reynolds.

My popular projects include flipbookr and ggplot2 extensions like ggcalendar, ggcirclepack and others.  Professionally, I've worked in higher education and government where my work involved analytics, teaching, and policy implementation.   

I'm interested in lightening cognative load, first, for interpreting data visualization and, second, for writing and reading code used to build data visualizations.  I believe the latter (working on coding tools) to greatly complement the former (communication via visualization itself). When we have logical, easy-to-use tools to build compelling, easy-to-interpret visualizations, we're more likely to build compelling, easy-to-interpret visualizations, rather than stop at 'good enough'.   Given this, I'm a big fan of the elegant, flexible, and intuitive grammar of graphics visualization frameworks. 

My technical expertise is in the ggplot2 library of the R language.  In the ggplot2 space I'm currently focused on extension, co-organizing the ggplot2 extenders club, creating 'easy geom recipes' together with students, writing ggplot2 extension cookbook, and developing 'express' methodologies for Stat extension (why shouldn't everyone be creating and using Stats?).  I've studied some of these new educational materials via survey response and focus groups. 

Previously, I had a greater focus on base ggplot2, creating materials like [a ggplot2 grammar guide](https://evamaerey.github.io/ggplot2_grammar_guide/about) and [the ggplot2 flipbook](https://evamaerey.github.io/ggplot_flipbook/ggplot_flipbook_xaringan.html#1).
