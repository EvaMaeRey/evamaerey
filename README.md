<!-- A combination of education and related technical/military/paraprofessional experience may be substituted for a bachelor’s degree on a year for year basis. An advanced degree (Masters or Doctorate) may be substituted for experience on a year for year basis if the degree is in a field of study directly related to the work assignment. -->

<!-- - [x]  Reproducible computing environments, containerization -->

I work on tools that make data analytics more fluid and intuitive and on
tools which expose this fluidity and elegance. These tools also allow us
to better record ‘conversations’ with data and workflows.

My popular projects include
[flipbookr](https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/flipbookr) (on CRAN and
maintained since 2020, with \>20000 downloads and used across
disciplines) and ggplot2 extensions like
[ggcalendar](https://evamaerey.github.io/ggcalendar/),
[ggcirclepack](https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/ggcirclepack) and others.

Professionally, I’ve worked in higher education and government where my
work involved analytics, teaching, and policy implementation.

I’m interested in lightening cognative load, first, when interpreting
data visualizations and, second, when writing and reading code used to
build data visualizations. I believe intuitiveness of plot composition
tools (coding and gui interfaces) often translates to more effective
visualization. With logical, easy-to-use tools, we’re better positioned
to build compelling, easy-to-interpret visualizations, rather than
stopping at ‘good enough’. For these reasons, I’m a big fan of the
elegant and intuitive grammar of graphics visualization frameworks.

My technical expertise is in ggplot2 and my current focus is on
extension and supporting extenders. I co-founded and organize the
[ggplot2 extenders
club](https://ggplot2-extenders.github.io/ggplot-extension-club/)…

, have created [‘easy geom
recipes’](https://evamaerey.github.io/easy-geom-recipes/), am writing
[ggplot2 extension
cookbook](https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/ggplot2-extension-cookbook), and
developing [‘express’ methodologies for
extension](https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/ggexpress) (why shouldn’t
everyone be using extension and why shouldn’t we be using them even on
an *ad hoc* basis?).

I’ve studied some of these new educational materials via [survey
response and focus
groups](https://evamaerey.github.io/easy-geom-recipes/survey_results_summary.html).
For more on the motivation for these efforts, see [‘everyday ggplot2
extension’](https://evamaerey.github.io/everyday_ggplot2_extension/).

I’m interested in the transformational effects that access to tailored,
principled data visualization tools can have on analytic and teaching
spaces. I work on greater accessibility for analysts, research, and
students to craft tool suited to their particular data challenges.

Previously, I had a greater focus on illuminating the grammar of *base*
ggplot2, creating materials like [a ggplot2 grammar
guide](https://evamaerey.github.io/ggplot2_grammar_guide/about) and [the
ggplot2
flipbook](https://evamaerey.github.io/ggplot_flipbook/ggplot_flipbook_xaringan.html#1).

I am also especially interested in entry points to R package writing,
working on resources like a [’companion
guide](https://evamaerey.github.io/package_in_20_minutes/package_in_20_minutes)
to to Jim Hester’s talk how to write and R package in 20 minutes’ (2000)
I have also looked comparatively at literate package writing tools of
[{fusen}](https://thinkr-open.github.io/fusen/),
[{litr}](https://jacobbien.github.io/litr-project/), and my own
‘readme-to-package’ approach, including via an coordinating a virtual
meeting with the authors at RLadies Denver, [March 2024
meeting](meetup.com/rladies-denver/events/299879858/?eventOrigin=group_past_events).
The [note package (2025)](https://github.com/musician-tools/note) uses
my [{knitrExtra}](https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/knitrExtra) package to
create the note package (a lightly rewritten version of what Jim Hester
presented) from within a README.
