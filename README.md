# Hi. I'm Gina Reynolds.

My popular projects include [flipbookr](https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/flipbookr) and ggplot2 extensions like [ggcalendar](https://evamaerey.github.io/ggcalendar/), [ggcirclepack](https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/ggcirclepack) and others.  

Professionally, I've worked in higher education and government where my work involved analytics, teaching, and policy implementation.   

I'm interested in lightening cognative load, first, when interpreting data visualizations and, second, when writing and reading code used to build data visualizations.  I believe intuitiveness of coding tools can ultimately greatly  the effectiveness of visualizations. With logical, easy-to-use tools, we're more likely to build compelling, easy-to-interpret visualizations, rather than stopping at 'good enough'.   For these reasons, I'm a big fan of the elegant and intuitive grammar of graphics visualization frameworks. 

My technical expertise is in the ggplot2 and currently focus on extension and supporting extenders.  I co-organize the [ggplot2 extenders club](https://github.com/teunbrand/ggplot-extension-club/discussions), have created ['easy geom recipes'](https://evamaerey.github.io/easy-geom-recipes/) together with students, am writing [ggplot2 extension cookbook](https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/ggplot2-extension-cookbook), and developing ['express' methodologies for Stat extension](https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/statexpress) (why shouldn't everyone be creating and using Stats and why shouldn't they be using them even on an *ad hoc* basis?).  I've studied some of these new educational materials via [survey response and focus groups](https://evamaerey.github.io/easy-geom-recipes/survey_results_summary.html). For more on the motivation for these efforts, see ['everyday ggplot2 extension'](https://evamaerey.github.io/everyday_ggplot2_extension/).

I'm interested in the transformational effects that access to custom, principled data visualization tooling can have on analytic and teaching spaces.  I am working on greater accessibility for researchers, academics, and students to bespoke tooling.

Previously, I had a greater focus on illuminating the grammar of *base* ggplot2, creating materials like [a ggplot2 grammar guide](https://evamaerey.github.io/ggplot2_grammar_guide/about) and [the ggplot2 flipbook](https://evamaerey.github.io/ggplot_flipbook/ggplot_flipbook_xaringan.html#1).
