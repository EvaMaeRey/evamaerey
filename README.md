# Hi. I'm Gina Reynolds.

My popular projects include [flipbookr](https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/flipbookr) and ggplot2 extensions like [ggcalendar](https://evamaerey.github.io/ggcalendar/), [ggcirclepack](https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/ggcirclepack) and others.  

Professionally, I've worked in higher education and government where my work involved analytics, teaching, and policy implementation.   

I'm interested in lightening cognative load, first, when interpreting data visualizations and, second, when writing and reading code used to build data visualizations.  I believe intuitiveness of plot composition tools (coding interfaces) often translates to more effectiveness of visualizations. With logical, easy-to-use tools, we're more likely to build compelling, easy-to-interpret visualizations, rather than stopping at 'good enough'.   For these reasons, I'm a big fan of the elegant and intuitive grammar of graphics visualization frameworks. 

My technical expertise is in ggplot2 and my current focus is on extension and supporting extenders.  I co-founded and co-organize the [ggplot2 extenders club](https://ggplot2-extenders.github.io/ggplot-extension-club/), have created ['easy geom recipes'](https://evamaerey.github.io/easy-geom-recipes/), am writing [ggplot2 extension cookbook](https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/ggplot2-extension-cookbook), and developing ['express' methodologies for extension](https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/ggexpress) (why shouldn't everyone be using extension and why shouldn't we be using them even on an *ad hoc* basis?).  I've studied some of these new educational materials via [survey response and focus groups](https://evamaerey.github.io/easy-geom-recipes/survey_results_summary.html). For more on the motivation for these efforts, see ['everyday ggplot2 extension'](https://evamaerey.github.io/everyday_ggplot2_extension/).


I'm interested in the transformational effects that access to tailored, principled data visualization tools can have on analytic and teaching spaces.  I work on greater accessibility for analysts, research, and students to craft tool suited to their particular data challenges.

Previously, I had a greater focus on illuminating the grammar of *base* ggplot2, creating materials like [a ggplot2 grammar guide](https://evamaerey.github.io/ggplot2_grammar_guide/about) and [the ggplot2 flipbook](https://evamaerey.github.io/ggplot_flipbook/ggplot_flipbook_xaringan.html#1).

I am also especially interested in entry points to R package writing, working on resources like a ['companion guide to to Jim Hester's talk how to write and R package in 20 minutes' (2000)](https://evamaerey.github.io/package_in_20_minutes/package_in_20_minutes) I have also looked comparatively at literate package writing tools of [{fusen}](https://thinkr-open.github.io/fusen/), [{litr}](https://jacobbien.github.io/litr-project/), and my own 'readme-to-package' approach, including via an coordinating a virtual meeting with the authors (RLadies Denver, [March 2024 meeting](meetup.com/rladies-denver/events/299879858/?eventOrigin=group_past_events).  The [note package (2025)](https://github.com/musician-tools/note) uses my [{knitrExtra}](https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/knitrExtra) package to create the note package (a lightly rewritten version of what Jim Hester presented) from within a README.
