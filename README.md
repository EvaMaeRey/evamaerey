# Hi. I'm Gina Reynolds.

My popular projects include flipbookr and ggplot2 extensions like ggcalendar, ggcirclepack and others.  I've worked in higher education and government in analytics, in the classroom, and policy implementation.   

My primary interest is lifting cognative load for interpreting data visualization as well as code to create data visualizations.  Given the later interest, I'm a huge proponent of the elegant and intuitive grammar of graphics visualization frameworks. My technical expertise is in ggplot2 in the R language. 

I co-organize the ggplot2 extenders club, created 'easy geom recipes' together with students, am working on the ggplot2 extension cookbook, and develop express methodologies for Stat extension (why shouldn't everyone be creating and using stats?).  I've studied new educational materials for extension via survey response and focus groups.
